- Brain development and vascular organization are discussed in this module.
- Cross-species brain comparisons reveal similarities in basic structures like the cortex, brainstem, thalamus, and cerebellum.
- The corpus callosum and hippocampus show similarities between human and chimpanzee brains.
- Similar basal structures are observed in mouse, cat, and human brains, with cortex size being the major difference.
- Similarities in brain organization allow experiments in simpler life forms to inform findings in human neuroscience.
- The developmental progress of the brain includes the neural tube development, hindbrain, tectum, tegmentum, and endbrain (cortex).
- The cortex, forming last, represents the most significant difference between humans and simpler life forms in brain development.
- The brain's vascular anatomy involves an intricate system of arteries and veins supplying energy and oxygen.
- Blood is supplied through the internal carotid artery, terminating into the Circle of Willis, which distributes blood throughout the brain.
- Various arteries, including the middle cerebral artery, distribute blood to specific and distinct areas of the brain.
- Cortical vascular territories are created, supplying specific areas of the brain based on arteries or veins.
- Understanding the vascular anatomy is crucial for FMRI research and the origination of the MR signal.
