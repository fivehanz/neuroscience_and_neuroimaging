- The human brain consists of two categories of specialized cells: neurons and glia.
- Neurons are highly specialized and interconnected cellular units, forming the fundamental processing unit of the brain and central nervous system.
- Neurons have different types, properties, shapes, and sizes, with basic properties including axons, cell bodies, dendrites, and axon terminals.
- Axons transmit electrical signals, cell bodies contain the nucleus and specialized organelles, dendrites receive signals, and axon terminals communicate with other neurons.
- Glia forms the majority of cells in the central nervous system, providing support, metabolic support for neurons, removing excessive secretions, and producing myelin for insulation.
- The brain can be organized by cytoarchitectural organization, sociable brain structures, and sociable brain networks.
- Cytoarchitectural organization is based on cellular composition, with Brodmann areas used to report neuroimaging findings.
- Brodmann areas are not limited to the human brain and provide a comparison method with animal brain organization.
- Detailed brain atlases, both printed and electronic, are available, showing named brain structures and their locations.
- Sociable brain structures can be identified by cell type and anatomical boundaries on MRI scans or post-mortem tissues.
- Sociable brain networks, like the striatum and medial temporal lobe, are formed by groups of interconnected structures.
- There's a rudimentary anatomical classification based on six lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, limbic, and insular cortex.
- This classification is still valid today, as broadly organized structural areas have common functions associated with them.

- The module focuses on the vascular anatomy of the human brain.
- The brain requires a significant amount of energy and oxygen, supplied by a complex system of arteries and veins.
- An angiogram illustrates the blood supply to the head and brain, emphasizing the intricate innervation of the blood supply.
- The internal carotid artery, originating from the aorta, is crucial for supplying blood to the brain.
- The Circle of Willis acts as a significant junction for the distribution of blood to specific brain areas.
- Blood is distributed from the Circle of Willis to various arteries and veins, supplying specific brain regions.
- Specific arteries, including the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery, play key roles in providing organized blood supply.
- The highly organized system of blood vessels creates specific cortical vascular territories in the brain.
- Neuro-imaging methods benefit from understanding the specific origin of blood supply, aiding in delineating areas of the cortex.
